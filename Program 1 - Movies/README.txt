Description:
This program is fairly simple to run; there is an included "make" file that allows the user to just type in "make" to create the executable.
The executable  will be called "movies", so to run the program type the command "./movies <movies_list.csv>", where "movies_list.csv" is a file
containing the list of movies. Included in this zip file is the sample list of movies "movies_sample_1", the main program "movies.c", and the header
file "movies.h". To run the sample file of movies run the command "./movies movies_sample_1.csv". To clean all created files, run the command "make clean".
